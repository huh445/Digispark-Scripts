# How to use?

## How do you set up the Digispark ATTINY85 for use with these scripts?
There are two easy ways to run these scripts, you can either use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/).
Alternatively, you can use my **UNFINISHED** [uploader](https://github.com/huh445/Digispark-Uploader) program, which downloads this repo automatically and makes it easier to upload to ATTINY85.

## How Does the Background Changer Work?

1. **Go to `ChangeBackground.ps1`.**
2. **Open it in a text editor** (any text editor works).
3. **Edit the link** to any image link address.
4. **Go to a text hosting site** such as [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/).
5. **Paste the text** into the site.
6. **Follow the instructions** provided in the text.
7. **Copy the link** to the raw text.
8. **Paste the link** into the `.ino` file.
9. **Save the file.**
10. **Run it!**

# Digispark Scripts
Just a few scripts that I have made to troll my friends along the way!
- Tested and working on Windows 11
- Made in 2024
- The PowerShell ones are not commented because of storage constraints.

## Why download PowerShell instead of running the commands off of the Digispark?
- I have had issues where the Digispark does not upload properly or doesn't upload at all when the total storage is above 58%.

## What scripts are there currently?
> Force a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)

All scripts below use PowerShell instead of HID:
> Change a background to any image

> Change some keybinds

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcome and encouraged if you have any scripts for OS's other then Windows 11. All malicious scripts will be rejected.
