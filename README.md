# Digispark Scripts
Just a few scripts that I have made to troll my friends along the way!
- Tested and working Windows 11
- Made 2024
## What scripts are there currently?
>Force a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)

>Change a background to any image

## What is the Picker?
- I need to make a better name for it!

The Picker is a program built in c# that automatically uploads the sketches in this repository.
It is useful when you don't have much time as the Arduino IDE takes so long to launch.
It is of course a lot quicker if you have the Arduino Extension set up in VSCode!

- This is still a WIP!

>It still needs to save from the last instance where your Arduino CLI is located!

## How does the background changer work?
1. Go to ChangeBackground.ps1.
2. Open it in a text editor (any works).
3. Edit the link to any image link address.
4. Go to a text hosting site such as https://pastebin.com/.
5. Put the text in.
6. Copy the link to the raw text.
7. Paste the link in the ino file.
8. Run!
